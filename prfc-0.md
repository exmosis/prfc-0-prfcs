**Summary**

A personal RFC is a "quick spec" for a particular project, effort, process, etc. A PRFC is a method to outline the reasons, methods and outcomes for such an effort, as well as highlight questions and encourage open collaboration. This is a PRFC for further PRFCs, and should be considered a work in progress.

**Background**

I have lots of ideas for projects, but it's easy to have a quick idea, start on building it, then wonder where it's heading halfway through the build. I've also been looking for ways to share and discuss ideas with others more easily, spurred on by various attempts at openness and working transparently. Finally, I seem fairly short on time to put a lot of work into possibly fairly throwaway ideas. I'm looking for a low-friction, low-cost method to do all this.

In other work, I have found it very helpful to adopt a lightly structured approach to help start out with a base 'template' to jot ideas down. This PRFC is a meta-PRFC to define how these 'templates for ideas' can be most helpful.

**Aims**

A PRFC aims to:

*   Help explain, explore and define a project or idea
*   Raise questions for a project or idea to remove blockages
*   Be quick to setup
*   Be easy to edit
*   Be easy to share
*   Allow feedback
*   Be easy to see changes

**Spec**

*   A PRFC should start out with the following section structure: Summary, Meta, Background, Aims, Specification, Questions, And Resources
    *   The "Summary" section should provide a quick description of what the PRFC covers
    *   The "Meta" section should provide information about the state of the PRFC - contact details, version number, URL, etc. There is otherwise no set list of metadata that must be included.
    *   The "Background" section should explain in more depth the context and need for the idea or project.
    *   The "Aims" section should set out some high level objectives and outcomes that the idea or project wants to achieve. This section is important - the fewer and more concrete the aims, the easier it is to define spec, and gauge progress.
    *   The "Spec" section should list more formal criteria that a solution should adopt. Generally, the spec should follow use of terms "must", "should", "may", to be clear about what is optional and what is not.
    *   The "Questions" section should highlight open questions and uncertainties that will affect the PRFC.
    *   Finally, the "Resources" section provides a place to keep track of any related or interesting material.
*   It should be possible to track changes to a PRFC, version a PRFC, to link to versions, and to obtain a feed of changes
*   It should be possible for others to comment on a PRFC in some way, although not necessarily inline
*   It is useful if others are able to easily copy a PRFC to adapt for their own purposes. It may be useful to accept changes back into the original PRFC ("forking PRFCs")
