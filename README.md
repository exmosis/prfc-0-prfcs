PRFC 0: Personal Requests for Comments

A personal RFC is a "quick spec" for a particular project, effort, process, etc. A PRFC is a method to outline the reasons, methods and outcomes for such an effort, as well as highlight questions and encourage open collaboration. This is a PRFC for further PRFCs, and should be considered a work in progress.
